    "Second, facial muscles relax during the treatment, Olson says, which lessens the appearance of wrinkles.",
    "Acupuncturists believe that the body's energy, or chi, takes certain pathways.",
    "By using needles to access points on those pathways, an acupuncturist can move the energy where it's needed to speed healing or eliminate damage.",
    "While there's no scientific evidence to back up these claims, cosmetic acupuncture may have some benefits, says Dr. Barney Kenet, a dermatologic surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.",
    "``Next to the sun, contraction of facial muscles is the major cause of wrinkling.",
    "That's why we get smile lines and crow's-feet,'' Kenet says.",
    "``If acupuncture relaxes the muscles, it might reduce wrinkling temporarily.''",
    "As for the increased blood flow, at most it will probably give you a temporary rosy complexion something you don't want if you have an inflammatory condition such as acne or rosacea.",
    "Otherwise, cosmetic acupuncture is relatively harmless.",
    "If you're interested in trying it, keep expectations in check and enjoy the experience.",
    "Aside from the momentary stings, acupuncture is really quite relaxing, Olson says.",
    "The treatment depending on the amount of wrinkles consists of about 20 to 25 superfine needles being inserted into the face, ear or hand.",
    "The price runs from $60 to $100 per session.",
    "What sort of results can you expect?",
    "Improvement after the first treatment can last about a week.",
    "After 10 weekly sessions, the body's energy will begin moving into these areas on its own.",
    "Monthly treatments can maintain the results, Olson says.",
    "In a study of patients recovering from a first heart attack, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) plus a drug that increases blood flow to the heart predicted future heart attacks better than the standard exercise-stress test.",
    "The technique can be performed 48 hours after a heart attack, compared with a five-to-seven-day waiting period for the stress test.",
    "``If there's danger of a second cardiac event, this can enable physicians to make lifesaving treatment decisions earlier,'' says Dr. Kenneth A.",
    "Brown, author of the study and director of the nuclear-cardiology and cardiac-stress laboratories at the University of Vermont in Burlington, where the study was conducted.",
    "is available at most large and medium-size hospitals.",
    "Lidocaine nose drops, available by prescription, may offer the fastest relief from a migraine headache.",
    "In a study at the Southern California Permanente Medical Group in Woodland Hills, researchers found that the medication eased pain within 15 minutes for 36 percent of patients, compared to 7 percent of those given a placebo.",
    "follow-up study found that the treatment brought relief within 30 minutes to more than half of the migraine sufferers who tried it.",
    "``The best candidates for lidocaine are those who have occasional migraines,'' says Dr. Morris Maizels, lead study author and a family-practice doctor at Permanente.",
    "If you experience symptoms before the migraine itself, Maizels advises, ``a quick lidocaine treatment may prevent the pain from setting in at all.''",

    "Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.",
    "District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected all of Napster's legal arguments and ruled that the program is primarily a conduit for ``wholesale infringing'' of copyright laws.",
    "The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who use the Internet program to trade free music with each other.",
    "And officials with the San Mateo startup claim the ruling could be a death blow to its fledgling business because, it said, its program cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs.",
    "Napster executives said they will appeal as early as Thursday to keep Napster online.",
    "The company's high-powered defense attorney David Boies said Napster will have to shut down the service if a higher court does not grant a stay of the injunction.",
    "``We are surprised and disappointed,'' Napster's interim CEO Hank Barry said moments after the verdict.",
    "``We understand the ruling and the basis for it, but we disagree with it.",
    "We do not believe Napster users are acting illegally.''",
    "Patel issued her much-anticipated ruling at the end of a 21/2 hour hearing.",
    "The judge's small courtroom was packed, and more than 150 lawyers, journalists, online music company executives and Napster fans had to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television in an adjoining courtroom.",
    "Patel's ruling is historic because it sets the tone for how the established entertainment industries deal with the increasing problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster.",
    "Already, other programs like Gnutella, Freenet and Scour have extended the Napster ``peer-to-peer'' file-sharing concept to digital pictures and first-run movies.",
    "The same idea could be used to swap electronic books and computer software.",
    "``This decision will pave the way for the future of online music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement in December.",
    "The quick rise of the Napster program, originally written by a 19-year-old college student, Shawn Fanning, alarmed the $40 billion U.S. recording industry.",
    "Napster estimates there are 20 million users of the program, first released in August 1999.",
    "Once considered a fad among teens and college students, Napster has now also become popular with people of all ages.",
    "Napster user Hidehiro Beppu, 21, studying math at the University of California at Berkeley, was also disappointed.",
    "``This is bogus.",
    "Napster doesn't do anything.",
    "It's like people copying music on tapes and giving it to friends.''",
    "The Napster software links users to various servers run by Napster Inc. People can easily search for any MP3-formated song stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users.",
    "When selected, the songs are copied from one computer to another.",
    "This vast ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing network has the ability to find almost any recorded song in the world, from the latest Britney Spears top-10 pop hit to an obscure 19th century folk song.",
    "The recording industry complained that the ability to download free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the musical world.",
    "The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in lost sales.",
    "new study released Wednesday by online research firm Jupiter Communications Inc. called Napster ``the definitive killer application for the online music industry.''",
    "Los Angeles attorney Russell Frackman, representing the recording companies, said Napster would grow to 75 million users downloading billions of songs by the end of the year if left unchecked.",
    "``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Frackman said.",
    "``The longer this goes on, the more impossible it will be for us and, we believe, for the court, to do anything realistic.''",
    "Napster's defense team headed by Boies, who led the U.S. government's recent successful antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, relied on legal precedents set by previous court decisions that allowed VCR owners to copy movies.",

    "``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new technologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with those technologies than previous generations.''",
    "Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger paints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited.",
    "We want to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling clay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of expressiveness.''",
    "At least one intriguing program is already under development at MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar.''",

    "However, a recent addition to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.",

    "The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc. to deliver the names of 335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs available for free downloads last weekend.",
    "But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the music.''",
    "At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica, Ulrich debated with a Napster fan.",
    "And after Ulrich left, a longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in protest.",
    "``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet?''",
    "Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is seeking $10 million in damages.",
    "On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties and their livelihoods.",
    "On the other side are fans, who say the greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.",
    "Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by Ulrich and attorney Howard E. King.",
    "``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a statement.",
    "``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram said.",
    "Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for any music.",
    "Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into the MP3 compression format.",
    "Act because it has no control over its users' actions.",
    "British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435 Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free download.",
    "The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.",
    "The Napster members were identified by their user names, which they gave Napster when they registered to download the program, along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their numerical Internet Protocol address.",
    "Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.",
    "Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders from reregistering.",
    "But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.",
    "``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.",
    "``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question about that.''",
    "And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is right.''",
    "Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of Napster users as immoral.",
    "``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich said.",
    "Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We want online music to be on our conditions.''",
